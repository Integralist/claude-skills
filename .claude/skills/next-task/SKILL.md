# Next Task

Resume work from a project plan document using an agent team (default) or
directly in the main thread (`--skip-agents`).

## Context

- Project plans: !`find docs/plans -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' ! -name 'README.md' -newer docs/plans/completed 2>/dev/null | head -10 || find docs/plans -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' ! -name 'README.md' 2>/dev/null | head -10`

## Process

1. **Identify the project plan:**

   - If the user specified a plan file, use that.

   - Otherwise, look at the context above for non-completed plans.

   - If multiple plans exist, present the options and ask the user
     which one to use. Format as a numbered list with the filename.

   - **Always tell the user which plan you're going to use and wait
     for confirmation before proceeding.** Example:

     ```text
     I'll work from docs/plans/cross-team-routing-isolation.md.
     OK, or did you have a different plan in mind?
     ```

1. **Read the plan** and find the first unchecked task (`- [ ]`).

1. **Announce the task** you're about to work on:

   ```text
   Next up: Task 2.3 — Add cache invalidation for config updates
   ```

1. **Execute the task** — choose one of two modes:

### Mode A: Agent team (default)

- Create a team named `next-task-<plan-slug>` using `TeamCreate`.
- Create a task for the work item using `TaskCreate` with the
  `team_name`.
- Spawn a `general-purpose` agent on the team with the
  `team_name` parameter. Include in the agent prompt:
  - The full text of the task from the plan
  - The plan file path for reference
  - Key files mentioned in the plan relevant to this task
  - Instruction to write tests first (no code without a failing
    test)
  - Instruction to run `make test` when done
  - Instruction to NOT mark the checkbox as complete
  - Instruction to NOT commit — leave that to the user
  - The project's layer separation: handlers -> service ->
    repository
  - Instruction to use `SendMessage` to report findings and
    status back to team-lead when done
  - Instruction to mark their task completed via `TaskUpdate`
- Notify the user that the agent is working. They can switch
  to the agent's thread to interact with it directly, or wait for
  the agent to report back via `SendMessage`.

### Mode B: Direct execution (`--skip-agents`)

- Do the implementation work yourself in the main thread.
- Follow the same rules the agent would follow:
  - Write tests first (no code without a failing test)
  - Run `make test` when done
  - Do NOT mark the checkbox as complete in the plan
  - Do NOT commit — leave that to the user
  - Respect the project's layer separation: handlers -> service ->
    repository

## REQUIRED

- You MUST confirm the plan choice before proceeding.
- One task per invocation. Don't chain multiple tasks.
- Agent mode (default) delegates to an agent team. Use it when the
  task is large enough to eat into main-thread context or when
  multiple tasks can be parallelised. For tiny, self-contained
  changes, do the work inline instead — no need to spawn an agent
  for a one-line fix.
- When delegating: you MUST use `TeamCreate` to create a team and
  spawn the agent on it with `team_name`. You MUST NOT do the
  implementation work yourself.
- When using `--skip-agents`, you MUST do the work directly — do
  not create teams or spawn agents.

## Prerequisites

### Claude Code agent teams (experimental) — agent mode only

The default agent mode uses
[agent teams](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agent-teams)
(`TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`) to run
the implementation agent. Enable the feature by adding the
following to `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1"
  }
}
```
