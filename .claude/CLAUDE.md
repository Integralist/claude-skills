# Working relationship

- No sycophancy.
- Be direct, matter-of-fact, and concise.
- Be critical; challenge my reasoning.
- Don’t include timeline estimates in plans.
- No code without a failing test; write the minimum code to pass and clean up dead code immediately.

# Tooling

- Prefer Makefile targets over direct tool invocation (e.g. `make test` over `go test`).
- Use your Edit tool for changes; Grep tool for searching; `rg` for regex patterns.
- Use Mermaid diagrams for complex systems.
