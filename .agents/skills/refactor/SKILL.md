# Refactor

Strategic refactoring skill. Investigates a feature in the
current codebase, identifies complexity and fragmentation, and
produces a reimplementation plan answering: "Knowing what we
know now, if we started from scratch, how would we do this
differently?"

## Input

The argument follows the skill invocation. If empty, prompt:

```txt
What feature or area do you want to refactor?
```

Parse the response into a short kebab-case slug (e.g.,
`auth-middleware`, `config-loading`) for use in file names.

## Gather project metadata

Before spawning the investigation subagent, run the following
git commands in the current working directory to build a
diagnostic snapshot. Capture the output and include it in the
subagent prompt as context.

### Churn hotspots — most-changed files in the last year

```bash
git log --format=format: --name-only --since="1 year ago" \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

### Bus factor — contributors ranked by commit count

```bash
git shortlog -sn --no-merges
```

Also check recent activity (last 6 months) to flag absent top
contributors:

```bash
git shortlog -sn --no-merges --since="6 months ago"
```

### Bug clusters — files most often touched in bug-fix commits

```bash
git log -i -E --grep="fix|bug|broken" \
  --name-only --format='' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

### Commit velocity — commits per month

```bash
git log --format='%ad' --date=format:'%Y-%m' \
  | sort | uniq -c
```

### Crisis patterns — reverts, hotfixes, and rollbacks

```bash
git log --oneline --since="1 year ago" \
  | grep -iE 'revert|hotfix|emergency|rollback'
```

### Cross-reference

Files that appear in **both** the churn hotspots and the bug
clusters lists are the highest-risk code. Flag these explicitly
in the metadata passed to the subagent.

## Investigation Phase

Spawn a single subagent (exploration / investigation role). The
subagent prompt must include:

- The feature or area to investigate
- The current working directory
- The **project metadata** gathered above — instruct the
  subagent to use this metadata to prioritize which code to
  investigate first and to corroborate its findings against the
  empirical data
- The investigation checklist below (include verbatim)
- Instructions to use file reading, search, and any relevant
  language tools available

### Investigation checklist

Include this verbatim in the subagent prompt:

> You are a principal engineer performing a strategic code
> review. Your goal is to deeply understand a feature's
> implementation and answer: "If we were to reimplement this
> from scratch, what would we do differently?"
>
> **Map the implementation:**
>
> - Identify all files, functions, types, and interfaces
>   involved
> - Trace the data flow and control flow end-to-end
> - Document the public API surface and internal boundaries
> - Note which packages/modules own which responsibilities
>
> **Identify complexity hotspots:**
>
> - Functions longer than 50 lines that do multiple things
> - Deep nesting (>3 levels)
> - High cyclomatic complexity
> - Complex conditionals or switch statements
> - Functions with many parameters (>4)
>
> **Identify fragmentation:**
>
> - Logic for the same concern scattered across multiple
>   packages
> - Duplicated patterns that should be unified
> - Inconsistent abstractions (same concept modeled differently
>   in different places)
> - Leaky abstractions where internals bleed across boundaries
> - Orphaned helpers or utilities that belong closer to their
>   callers
>
> **Identify coupling issues:**
>
> - Circular or upward dependencies between packages
> - Concrete types used where interfaces would decouple
> - Shared mutable state or global variables
> - Tight coupling to external services without abstraction
>
> **Identify missing prerequisites:**
>
> - What interfaces, shared types, or abstractions should have
>   existed before this feature was built?
> - What test infrastructure (helpers, fixtures, fakes) is
>   missing?
> - What documentation or architectural decisions should have
>   been made first?
>
> **Structure your report as:**
>
> 1. **Implementation map** — files, types, and data flow
> 1. **Complexity hotspots** — ranked by severity
> 1. **Fragmentation issues** — ranked by impact
> 1. **Coupling issues** — ranked by risk
> 1. **Missing prerequisites** — what should have existed first
> 1. **Key insight** — the single most important thing to change

## Analysis

Synthesize the investigation findings into a coherent
reimplementation strategy. Focus on:

- What the root causes of complexity are (not just symptoms)
- What the ideal decomposition looks like
- What order things should be built in (prerequisites first)
- What can be preserved vs. what needs rewriting

## Plan Output

Create the output directory with `mkdir -p docs/plans`, then
write the plan to `docs/plans/refactor-<slug>.md`:

````markdown
# Refactor: {Feature Name}

- **Status**: Planning
- **Author**: {author from git config}
- **Created**: {YYYY-MM-DD}
- **Language**: {detected language}

## Summary

{One paragraph: what is wrong with the current implementation
and the high-level reimplementation strategy.}

## Current State

{Brief description of the current implementation — key files,
data flow, and where the problems are. Include a Mermaid
diagram if the system is complex.}

## What We Should Have Done First

{Prerequisites that should have existed before this feature
was built — interfaces, shared types, test infrastructure,
architectural decisions.}

## Reimplementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Prerequisites

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: {Prerequisite work}

  {Detailed notes with code snippets:}

  ```{language}
  // Example code showing the approach
  ```

### Phase 2: {Core Reimplementation}

- [ ] **Task 2.1**: {Specific task}

### Phase N-1: Documentation

- [ ] **Task (N-1).1**: Update `**/README.md` files for
  packages whose public API changed
- [ ] **Task (N-1).2**: Update `docs/**/*.md` for user-facing
  behavior changes

### Phase N: Verification

- [ ] **Task N.1**: {How to verify behavior is preserved}
- [ ] **Task N.2**: {How to verify complexity is reduced}

## File Changes

| File           | Change                         |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `path/to/file` | {Brief description of changes} |

## Surface Durable Rules

After producing the plan, review the investigation findings for
**systemic patterns** that should be codified as ongoing
conventions or anti-patterns — guidance that applies beyond this
specific refactor.

### Process

1. If the investigation surfaced no durable lessons, skip this
   step entirely. Do not force it.

2. For each candidate rule, check your project's rules or
   conventions directory for an existing file that covers the
   topic. Update it if one exists.

3. If no existing file covers the topic, create a new
   conventions file.

4. **Present the proposed rule(s) to the user for confirmation
   before writing.**

5. Only write after the user confirms.

## Guidelines

- Use specific file paths and line numbers when referencing
  code.
- Code snippets must use real function signatures, real types,
  real import paths. Not pseudocode.
- Break reimplementation into logical phases (prerequisites
  first, then core work, then verification).
- Each task should be small enough to complete in one session.
- The plan should describe a reimplementation, not incremental
  patches. The goal is "what would we do if starting over," not
  "what's the minimal diff."
- Include a verification phase with concrete test commands.
- Wrap all Markdown output at 80 columns.
