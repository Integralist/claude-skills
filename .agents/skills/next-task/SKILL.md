  Continue working through a project plan. Finds the next
  unchecked task and begins implementation. Use when the user
  says "next task", "continue", or wants to resume project
  plan work.

# Next Task

Resume work from a project plan document using a subagent
(default) or directly in the main thread (`--skip-agents`).

## Context

- Project plans: !`find docs/plans -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' ! -name 'README.md' -newer docs/plans/completed 2>/dev/null | head -10 || find docs/plans -maxdepth 1 -name '*.md' ! -name 'README.md' 2>/dev/null | head -10`

## Process

1. **Identify the project plan:**

   - If the user specified a plan file, use that.
   - Otherwise, look at the context above for non-completed
     plans.
   - If multiple plans exist, present the options and ask the
     user which one to use. Format as a numbered list with the
     filename.
   - **Always tell the user which plan you're going to use and
     wait for confirmation before proceeding.** Example:

     ```txt
     I'll work from docs/plans/cross-team-routing-isolation.md.
     OK, or did you have a different plan in mind?
     ```

1. **Read the plan** and find the first unchecked task
   (`- [ ]`).

1. **Announce the task** you're about to work on:

   ```txt
   Next up: Task 2.3 — Add cache invalidation for config
   updates
   ```

1. **Execute the task** — choose one of two modes:

### Mode A: Subagent (default)

Spawn a single subagent (general-purpose / workhorse role).
Include in the subagent prompt:

- The full text of the task from the plan
- The plan file path for reference
- Key files mentioned in the plan relevant to this task
- Instruction to write tests first (no code without a failing
  test)
- Instruction to run `make test` when done
- Instruction to update `docs/**/*.md` or `**/README.md` if
  the change alters behavior, public APIs, or usage patterns
- Instruction to NOT mark the checkbox as complete
- Instruction to NOT commit — leave that to the user
- The project's layer separation: handlers -> service ->
  repository

Notify the user that the subagent is working.

### Mode B: Direct execution (`--skip-agents`)

Do the implementation work yourself in the main thread. Follow
the same rules the subagent would follow:

- Write tests first (no code without a failing test)
- Run `make test` when done
- Update `docs/**/*.md` or `**/README.md` if the change
  alters behavior, public APIs, or usage patterns
- Do NOT mark the checkbox as complete in the plan
- Do NOT commit — leave that to the user
- Respect the project's layer separation: handlers -> service
  -> repository

## REQUIRED

- You MUST confirm the plan choice before proceeding.
- One task per invocation. Don't chain multiple tasks.
- Subagent mode (default) delegates to a subagent. Use it when
  the task is large enough to eat into main-thread context. For
  tiny, self-contained changes, do the work inline instead — no
  need to spawn a subagent for a one-line fix.
- When delegating: you MUST spawn a subagent. You MUST NOT do
  the implementation work yourself.
- When using `--skip-agents`, you MUST do the work directly —
  do not spawn subagents.
