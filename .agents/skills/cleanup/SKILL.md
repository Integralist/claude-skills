  Review codebase for AI slop and clean it up. Spawns a

  issues, and flags behavior-changing items for discussion.

# Cleanup Skill

Audit a codebase for AI slop using a background subagent. The
subagent fixes obvious issues directly and flags anything that
would change behavior. You can continue working while it runs.

## Input

The argument follows the skill invocation. Detect the scope:

| Argument          | Scope                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| No argument       | **Entire codebase**            |
| File path or glob | **Specific files/directories** |

## Gather File List

### Entire codebase (no argument)

Collect all source files. Exclude vendored, generated, and test
fixture directories (e.g. `vendor/`, `node_modules/`,
`testdata/`, `.git/`).

### Specific paths

Expand any globs, then validate paths exist.

If no files are found, report "No files to review" and stop.

## Gather project metadata

Before spawning the cleanup subagent, run the following git
commands to build a diagnostic snapshot. Use this to prioritize
which files to examine first — high-churn, high-bug files are
the most valuable targets for cleanup.

### Churn hotspots — most-changed files in the last year

```bash
git log --format=format: --name-only --since="1 year ago" \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

### Bug clusters — files most often touched in bug-fix commits

```bash
git log -i -E --grep="fix|bug|broken" \
  --name-only --format='' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -20
```

### Cross-reference

Files that appear in **both** the churn hotspots and the bug
clusters lists are the highest-risk code. Flag these explicitly
in the metadata passed to the subagent.

## Spawn One Subagent

Spawn a single subagent (general-purpose / workhorse role). The
subagent prompt must include:

- The full "What to look for" checklist below
- The list of files in scope
- The **project metadata** gathered above (churn hotspots, bug
  clusters, and cross-referenced high-risk files) — instruct
  the subagent to examine high-risk files first
- Instructions to work file by file, making edits directly
- Instructions to track every change and every flagged item

### Subagent instructions

Include this in the subagent prompt:

> You are a principal engineer performing a code quality audit.
> Your job is to find and fix "AI slop" — the telltale signs
> of AI-generated code that was accepted without proper review.
>
> **Rules:**
>
> - Fix issues directly unless the fix would change behavior
> - For behavior-changing fixes, flag them but do not edit
> - Do not make changes that violate the language's or
>   codebase's conventions
> - Be aggressive about removing slop but conservative about
>   changing behavior
>
> When code changes alter behavior, public APIs, or usage
> patterns, update the corresponding `docs/**/*.md` or
> `**/README.md` files. Do not create new documentation
> files unless the change introduces a wholly new component.
>
> When finished, report your findings. Structure your report
> as:
>
> 1. **Changes made** — list of files edited with a one-line
>    summary of each change
> 1. **Flagged for discussion** — items that would change
>    behavior, with file, line, description, and rationale
> 1. **Files reviewed with no issues** — count only

### What to look for

Include this checklist verbatim in the subagent prompt:

#### Unnecessary verbosity

- Overly defensive code: nil checks that can't fire, error
  handling for impossible cases, redundant type assertions
- Wrapper functions that add no value — just forwarding calls
  with no additional logic
- Variables assigned once and immediately returned; inline them
- Unnecessary else branches after a return

#### Duplicated code

- Copy-pasted logic that should be extracted into a shared
  function
- Near-identical switch/case arms that could be collapsed
- Repeated string literals that should be constants

#### Comment problems

- Comments that restate what the code does
  ("increment i by 1")
- Temporal comments ("added this to fix the bug",
  "this was needed because...")
- Uncertain thinking leaked into comments ("actually",
  "but wait", "I think", "probably")
- Commented-out code that should be deleted

#### Naming issues

- Variables named `result`, `data`, `temp`, `val`, `ret` when
  a descriptive name exists
- Boolean variables/functions not named as predicates (should
  read as a question)
- Inconsistent naming conventions within the same file

#### Structural issues

- Functions that are too long (>50 lines) and do multiple
  things
- Deep nesting (>3 levels) that could be flattened with early
  returns
- Dead code: unused functions, unreachable branches, vestigial
  parameters
- Temporary files, debug prints, or scaffolding left behind
- Imports that are no longer needed

#### Over-engineering

- Abstractions with only one implementation
- Interface types with a single concrete user
- Configuration for things that never vary
- Builder/factory patterns where a simple constructor suffices

## Compile Summary

After the subagent has reported, create the output directory
with `mkdir -p docs/plans`, then write the report to
`docs/plans/cleanup-<YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM>.md`:

```markdown
## Cleanup Report

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM
**Scope:** entire codebase | specific paths
**Files reviewed:** <count>
**Files changed:** <count>
**Items flagged:** <count>

### Changes Made

[Group by category — verbosity, duplication, comments, naming,
structure, over-engineering. Each item: file, line, what
changed.]

### Flagged for Discussion

[Items that would change behavior. Each item: file, line,
description, why it matters, suggested fix.]
```

Print a short summary and the file path in the conversation.
