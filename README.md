# Claude Code Configuration

This repository contains my **global Claude Code configuration** — skills, agents, and project instructions designed to be used across all projects when working with Claude AI.

## Components

### Skills (`skills/`)

[Claude Code Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) are custom code capabilities that extend Claude's ability to perform specific tasks, follow particular patterns, or apply specialized knowledge. Skills act as reusable instructions invoked with `/skill-name`.

Skills can include:

- **Coding conventions** and style preferences
- **Architecture patterns** and best practices
- **Testing strategies** and patterns
- **Framework-specific** patterns and idioms
- **Domain-specific** knowledge and approaches

### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

[Custom agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agents) are specialized sub-agents that Claude can spawn via the Task tool. Each agent has a specific purpose and can be configured with different models and instructions.

Current agents:

- **code-improvement-reviewer** — Reviews code for readability, performance, and best practices with concrete before/after suggestions

### Project Instructions (`.claude/CLAUDE.md`)

The [CLAUDE.md file](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#claudemd) defines working relationship preferences and tooling guidelines that apply globally. This includes:

- Communication style (concise, no sycophancy)
- Tooling preferences (prefer Makefile targets, use Edit over sed)
- Collaboration norms (challenge assumptions, do things right)

## Global Configuration

Everything in this repository is intended to be **global** — applying across all projects rather than being specific to a single codebase. These are universal patterns, conventions, and preferences I want Claude to follow consistently.

## Contributing

When adding to this repository:

1. Ensure additions are truly **global** and applicable across multiple projects
1. Write clear, concise descriptions that Claude can easily understand
1. Include examples where helpful
1. Avoid project-specific details or configurations
1. Test with Claude to ensure the desired behavior

## License

This repository contains personal coding skills and preferences. Feel free to use and adapt these skills for your own projects.

## Notes

I have a global gitignore that prevents `.claude/` from being committed. So I
have to `git add -f .claude/` every time I make a change.
