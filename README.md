# Agent Skills Configuration

This repository contains **global agent configuration** — skills, agents, rules,
and project instructions designed to be used across all projects when working
with AI coding assistants.

It serves two targets:

- **Claude Code** — reads `.claude/` (skills, agents, rules, CLAUDE.md)
- **Generic Agent Skills** (e.g. Swival) — reads `.agents/` (skills, AGENTS.md)

Skills exist in both locations. The `.claude/` versions use Claude-specific
primitives (TeamCreate, SendMessage, allowed-tools). The `.agents/` versions use
platform-agnostic language (subagents, role descriptions) so any compatible CLI
can use them.

## Install

```bash
# Claude Code only
make install-claude

# Generic agents only (e.g. Swival)
make install-agents

# Both
make install
```

## Components

### Skills

[Skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) are custom code capabilities
that extend an agent's ability to perform specific tasks, follow particular
patterns, or apply specialized knowledge. Skills act as reusable instructions
invoked with `/skill-name`.

### Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

[Custom agents](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/agents) are specialized
sub-agents that Claude can spawn via the Task tool. Each agent has a specific
purpose and can be configured with different models and instructions.

Current agents:

- **code-improvement-reviewer** — Reviews code for readability, performance, and
  best practices with concrete before/after suggestions

### Rules (`.claude/rules/`)

[Rules](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory#modular-rules-with-claude%2Frules%2F)
are modular, topic-specific instruction files that Claude loads automatically.
Unlike skills (which are invoked explicitly), rules apply passively — scoped to
file patterns via YAML frontmatter `paths` globs.

In `.agents/`, rules are converted to skills (`go-conventions`,
`markdown-conventions`) since generic agents don't support path-scoped
auto-loading.

### Project Instructions

- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — Claude Code global instructions
- `.agents/AGENTS.md` — Generic agent global conventions

## Workflow

- research-plan → critique → next-task → commit → code-review → cleanup →
  refactor

## Contributing

When adding to this repository:

1. Ensure additions are truly **global** and applicable across multiple projects
1. Write clear, concise descriptions to ensure accurate interpretation
1. Include examples where helpful
1. Avoid project-specific details or configurations
1. Create both `.claude/` and `.agents/` versions for new skills
1. Test with Claude to ensure the desired behavior

## License

This repository contains personal coding skills and preferences. Feel free to
use and adapt these skills for your own projects.

## Notes

I have a global gitignore that prevents `.claude/` from being committed. So I
have to `git add -f .claude/` every time I make a change.
